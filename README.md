# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes customer information, subscription details, and billing history. The goal is to identify high-risk customers and provide actionable insights to reduce churn.

## 🚀 How to Use `main.py`
`main.py` executes the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model training. Run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Perform feature engineering
3. Train a machine learning model
4. Save the trained model in the `models/` folder

## 📖 Instructions for Running the Pipeline
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Main Pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```
This will execute the full pipeline and print model evaluation metrics.

### 3️⃣ Make Predictions on New Data
To predict churn for new customers, modify `src/predict.py` and run:
```bash
python src/predict.py
```

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Deploy a Flask/FastAPI API for real-time predictions
- Add SHAP analysis for feature importance
